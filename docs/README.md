## Cheatsheet

The cheatsheet is a way to communicate some of the more complex ideas in the project visually.

The cheatsheet is `docs/zs_cheatsheet.png`.

### Updating the Cheatsheet

To update the cheatsheet, you need the drawio source file. This is `docs/zs_cheetsheet.drawio`.

Once you have the file, you need to use `drawio` (Public version: https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop)

If you are within Amazon, please use the [internal variant](drawio.corp.amazon.com).

Once you start `drawio`, select the cheatsheet source file and it will load it into drawio for editing.

Once finished editing, export to PNG with 200% zoom, and also save the updated source file.
Then send a pull request to this repo with these two files updated.
